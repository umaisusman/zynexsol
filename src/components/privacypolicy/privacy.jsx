                        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting
                        you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
                        monitored and collected. <br /> No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
                        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
                        automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. <br />If a standard for online tracking is adopted
                        that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
                        privacy policy.
